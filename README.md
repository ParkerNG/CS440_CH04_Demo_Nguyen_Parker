# CS440_CH04_Demo_Nguyen_Parker

I chose GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 for this repository for several reasons.

First, I strongly support the idea of full freedom to use a free software (freedom not free of charge) for educational purposes. If I create something that is useful, I would like other people to make use of it.

Second, I believe in the fact that if something is public, people will try to make it better by modifying it to be more suitable or appropriate. 

Third, I believe in the sharing ethic; I would reach out and help more people if I make my software public.

Overall, I chose this particular license because I believe in the freedom to copy, distribute and/or modify a software.
